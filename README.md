## Description for variables:
* r. Used to store the red component of the background color. It uses numbers asisgned randomly from 0 to 255.
* g. Used to store the green component of the background color. It uses numbers asisgned randomly from 0 to 255.
* b. Used to store the blue component of the background color. It uses numbers asisgned randomly from 0 to 255.
* size. This is a number variable that tracks the continuous increase in size of the white circles, which are intended to be clouds and fog, which slowly obscure the figure of the body. It starts at 0 (size = 0) and increases by 1 each frame (size = size + 1). The value of size is then added to the base size of the circles to make them expand over time.
